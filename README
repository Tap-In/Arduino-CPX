This is a cloud-based controller for the Arduino using the
Tap In Control Plan cloud based controller. An intermediate level
of working with the Arduino is assumed by this document.

Be aware that the WiFi shield and the RFID reader uses the same
MOSI pin, so, unless you know how to modify the hardware to change
the MOSI pins, use the RFID example with the USB based proxy.

This code is compiled to use the Arduino Mega, if you use another Arduino
board, you will need to make the appropriate modifications.

Enjoy,
