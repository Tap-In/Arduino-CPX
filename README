This is a cloud-based controller for the Arduino using the
Tap In Control Plan . An intermediate level
of skill in working with the Arduino is assumed by this project.

Be aware that the WiFi shield and the RFID reader use the same
SPI SS (Slave Select) pin, so, unless you know how to modify the 
hardware to change the  pins, use the RFID example with 
the USB based proxy.

The CPX code sets SPI SS to pin 53,  and Reset is on pin 5.

If using the RFID example, make sure you connect the Reset pin
of the RFID shield to pin 5 on the Arduino. Otherwise, if you
leave it dangling, the RFID will read once and then will time out. The 
reader is reset after every read, and if the reader doesn't get the signal
the subsequent reads will fail.

This code is written and compiled for use the Arduino Mega.
If you use another Arduino board, you will need to make the 
appropriate modifications to the software.

Enjoy,
